# It lives at '$BPAN_ROOT/config' (often '~/.bpan/config').
# BPAN created this file, guessing as many values as possible.
# You need to replace all the lines containing '___' with appropriate values.
# Feel free to remove lines that don't apply to you.

# Required. Do not remove.

# # Optional user info:
# irc = ___@irc.libera.chat
# matrix = @___:matrix.org

# A GitHub token is needed by BPAN package authors for `bpan publish`.
# IMPORTANT: The token needs the 'workflow' scope enabled.
# See: https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index
# Create a token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
