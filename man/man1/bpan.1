.SH "Installation"
You can install BPAN in any directory you want\. We recommend \fB~/\.bpan/\fR but it is completely up to you\. Whereever \fBbpan\fR is found in your \fBPATH\fR it will adjust everything else for you\. In other words, change \fB~/bpan\fR to your choice in these commands:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# Clone the client branch of the \'bpan\' repo:
git clone http://github\.com/bpan\-org/bpan ~/\.bpan \-\-branch=client
# Add these lines to your shell init file:
export PATH=~/\.bpan/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=~/\.bpan/man:$MANPATH
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.SH "Environment"
These variables all set automatically or you can set them yourself:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBBPAN_ROOT\fR

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBBPAN_LIB\fR

.P
These all have reasonable defaults, but feel free to do what you want\.

To get the value of an automatically set command, use the \fBbpan env\fR command:
